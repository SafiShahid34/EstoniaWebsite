        Tim Horton was a hockey player but is the name of a coffee chain, which means my dream of a goat sanctuary being my legacy is not unrealistic. Thank you for using my words in your work. A tagline for a special highway that is easy to navigate while under the influence of drugs: Take the High Road. I have a moral code, but I haven't figured out how to read it yet. If Fantasy Hockey actually lived up to its name, every team would have Henrik Lundqvist and Joffrey Lupul on it.
